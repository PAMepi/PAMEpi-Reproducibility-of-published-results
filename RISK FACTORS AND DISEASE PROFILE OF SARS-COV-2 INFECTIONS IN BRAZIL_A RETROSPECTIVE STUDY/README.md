# Reproducibility of published results:
# RISK FACTORS AND DISEASE PROFILE OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTIONS IN BRAZIL: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY


ToDo


## Tables

### Table 1

The mild to moderate infection counts are printed when the file [SG_agrupados.py](Code/SG_agrupados.py)
is run and the severe to critical infection counts when [SRAG_agrupados.py](Code/SRAG_agrupados.py)
is run. The total counts are the sum of both.

### Table 2


tabela\_vac\_srag.py


### Sup. Table 1

This figure is made with the results exported after running [logistic_regression_SRAG_death.py](Code/logistic_regression_SRAG_death.py),
that is stored in [logit_results.csv](Results/logit_results.csv). The odd-ratio CI 95\% can be
obtained using \[exp(value - 1.96*std), exp(value + 1.96*std)\]

On the results:
- the first row, "MORTE", is actually the constant parameter b0.
- the rows with dummy entries start with the reference category (like
age group from 40 to 50 or BDI class 0, with odd=1) and has the actual category
after a "\_".

Same as Table 2

## Figures


### Figure 1

The data necessary for this figure is generated by running [figure1_values.py](Code/figure1_values.py)
and is exported to the Results folder.

Data for each subplot:
A. [TimeSintomasInterna.csv](Results/TimeSintomasInterna.csv)
B. [HOSP_dur.csv](Results/HOSP_dur.csv)
C. [TimeSintomasICU.csv](Results/TimeSintomasICU.csv)
D. [ICU_dur.csv](Results/ICU_dur.csv)


### Figure 2

The data for each subfigure was made with a different file, and the data 
description is explained in each code header:
A. (ToDo)
B. The data was generated by [figures_raca_mort.py](Code/figures_raca_mort.py)
and exported to the file [fig2_ethnicity.csv](Results/fig2_ethnicity.csv).
C. The data was generated by [fig2_sex_vac.py](Code/fig2_sex_vac.py)
and exported to the files [mort_vacina_ICU.csv](Results/mort_vacina_ICU.csv) (for the ICU data)
and [mort_vacina_HOSP.csv](Results/mort_vacina_HOSP.csv) (for the non-ICU data).
D. The data was generated by the same code as Fig. 2C, but the data files are
[mort_sexo_ICU.csv](Results/mort_vacina_ICU.csv) (for the ICU data)
and [mort_sexo_HOSP.csv](Results/mort_vacina_HOSP.csv) (for the non-ICU data).

### Figure 3

Same as Sup. Table 1

### Sup. Figure 1

(ToDo: insert FS discussion)
The confirmed SARS data is printed after the script "Code/filter_SRAG.py" is run.

### Sup. Figure 2

ToDo

### Sup. Figure 3



### Sup. Figure 4

ToDo

### Sup. Figure 5

The file [Code/view_death_dur_stay.py](Code/view_death_dur_stay.py) generates
both the [figure](Figures/SFig5.png) and the data [file](Results/mort_dur_hosp.csv) needed to reproduce it.
